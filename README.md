## Local installation instructions:

If you would like to run the tutorial locally you will need a few things:

- **Python 3:** Most recent systems come with Python pre-installed. **Nilearn supports Python>=3.7.**
- **git:** `git` is the most popular VCS (version controlled software). Although we recommend having `git` installed to download these notebooks, you can also use the download button on GitHub. You can learn more on `git` [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).

If you have these tools installed, you can download the repository with the notebooks:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ymzayek/nilearn-PFC-Workshop.git
$ cd nilearn-PFC-Workshop
```

Although not required, we recommend creating and activating a virtual environment before installing the requirements:
The example show how to do this using Python venv module but you can use any environment package you're used to:

```
python3 -m venv nilearn_tutorial
source nilearn_tutorial/bin/activate
```

Install the requirements (this will install nilearn and its dependencies, as well as Jupyter-notebooks):

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Launch the notebooks:

```
$ cd Notebooks
$ jupyter-notebook
```

 The notebooks are based from previous nilearn tutorials:
